# Team 14 Project Charter

## Team Members:

Connor Collins, Emilio Lopez, John Park, Rohan Ramakrishnan, Yifan Wang, Legeng Yi

## Problem Statement:

Many companies are using coding challenges as their preferred method of interviewing candidates. We seek to create a website in which users have the ability to submit coding problems, to practice coding other problems, and to challenge their friends. Our project will be similar to other coding practice sites, but we seek to bring a competitive aspect by providing a tool to allow users to engage in friendly competition.

## Project Objectives:

* Allow users to compile and run code through a browser
* Create an attractive user interface
* Allow users to challenge friends to complete the same problem via social media
* Hope to foster a more engaged community by allowing users to submit their own problems and test cases

## Stakeholders:

* Computer Science students looking to better their coding skills
* Technology companies looking to improve programmers’ skills by submitting their own problems
* Software Engineers working on the project

## Project Deliverables:

Our goal is to create a web application that allows users to develop their computer science skills in a competitive yet collaborative environment. The deliverables will consist of:

* A web-based front-end using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
* A server-side back-end using Spring Boot and Spring MVC 
* A database for storing user and problem information using MySQL
* Compilation and execution of user code using the Sphere Engine Problems API
* Deployed on Amazon Web Services Elastic Beanstalk
