# Team 14 Product Backlog
# Code vs. Code

Connor Collins, Emilio Lopez, John Park, Rohan Ramakrishnan, Yifan Wang, Legeng Yi

## Problem Statement:
We seek to create a website in which users have the ability to submit and practice coding problems in a fun and competitive 
environment with their friends. Our project will be similar to other coding practice sites, but with a competitive aspect that 
allows users to engage in friendly competition. By focusing on friend challenges and content creation, we hope to create a 
unique experience amongst the many coding websites available.

## Background Information:
There are many websites for preparing for coding technical interviews such as LeetCode, TopCoder, and CareerCup. These websites 
allow the user to practice various coding problems but they don’t foster a sense of competition with friends, critical to maximizing
learning potential. For example, LeetCode allows you to choose from over 300 problems, but it doesn’t allow users to share their 
solution with friends or challenge their friends to the same problem. With our application, we intend to let users challenge their 
friends via a unique URL that lets their friends compare solutions and other statistics at the end. Our application is targeted
towards students preparing for their technical interviews or those trying to brush up on their coding skills.
